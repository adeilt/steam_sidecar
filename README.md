# I'm about to rename this to Miasmatic to avoid anyone thinking that Steam or Valve had anything to do with it. This is the last commit under the name "Steam Sidecar".

A Chrome extension to highlight Steam tags I like and don't like.

Possible future features I'm considering:

- surfacing other game attributes that are important to me and my friends (e.g. online co-op, some DRM systems, early access status, release date, etc.) so that the information is all in one easy-to-scan box
- searching the text of the reviews that show up on the page for certain keywords
- searching the discussions for the game for certain keywords

Thanks to stefanvd on github for the Chrome Extension template:
